# WeLoveMovies-server
My backend development capstone project through Thinkful. Practice in building a complex server and accessing data through a database. 
- Languages used include Node, Express, Knex, PostgreSQL.
- Tools used included [ElephantSQL](elephantsql.com) for the database instance, [DBeaver](dbeaver.io) for the database user interface, and [Postman](postman.com) for HTTP request testing. I also used [pino-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino-http) to implement logging and trace errors throughout my development process.


## ERD
Below is an entity relationship diagram depicting the structure of the database and its tables.
